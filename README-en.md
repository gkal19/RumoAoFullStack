<p align="center">My journey to becoming a Full-Stack Developer</p>
<br>
In April of 2018 I discovered that my PC had several problems and came to "die". With that I did not imagine that I would stay TIME TOO much without him. This time was essential for me to unlearn everything I knew that involved codes.

What happened was that I'm still without a computer and I'm depending on my father's computer. Anyway, anyone who knows my GitHub knows that I had an old repository called "Road to Back-End". And today, I decided to think outside the box and thought, "Why not become a Full-Stack Developer ???"
Whenever I learn something I will be posting on [my blog] (https://gkal19.github.io) and if possible try to create a project that is useful to the community.
